        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">In this passage, comic playwright Aristophanes parodies Hesiod’s Theogony by making a series of bizarre changes and additions to the genealogy that the ancient Greek audience would be familiar with. First, he creates an unlikely situation where birds, instead of deities talk down to humans. To add to the humor, the birds are there to tell the audience that humans are part of a weak and an unfortunate race that lives a dark life. Aristophanes increases the severity of the humans’ situation by juxtaposing it with that of the birds, which is characterized by immortality, ethereality and youth. The Greek audience may indeed acknowledge the humans’ inferiority as reality since they believed in their own mythologies, which portray humans as beings of low status. Thus, the kind of humor here is possibly a laugh-at-life humor, where people laugh at their own helplessness to bring relief to a situation that cannot be changed.
The next comedic change that Aristophanes introduces is the order of the primordial deities. While Hesiod tells us that Eros came before Night, Aristophanes tells us that it is the reverse. The comic playwright is perhaps relying on the common understanding that nighttime implies sexual activities to poke fun at the fact that there cannot be Eros or love without the Night. The swap is also befitting since Aristophanes must create a setting in which the birds’ status can be raised. Night is created first because it represents the sky, a physically high position where the gods and birds live. Eros then springs from an egg, appropriate since he is the creator of birds. To show their superior lineage, the birds continuously boast about how their progenitors have wings like them. The emphasis on wings as proof of superior lineage is used to demonstrate the ridiculous logic of the birds and therefore create humor.
Lastly, Aristophanes has the birds speak of the extent of their knowledge and power in an exaggerated manner to make this passage comical. When the birds talk about how much humans will know about the gods after listening to the birds, they claim that even the philosopher Prodicus will envy that knowledge. This cultural reference is funny because Prodicus is a famous philosopher respected even by Plato, so to the audience it must be absurd to think that their knowledge will surpass that of Prodicus. This parodic passage is concluded with an explicit and over the top description of the birds’ power to help lovers fulfill their sexual desires.</chars>

          <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">This artwork portrayed on drinking cups uses symbolic representations to show the untamed and unstructured nature of Dionysiac worship. On the first kylix, there are depictions of dancing maenads, or female followers of Dionysus. These maenads are wonderful indicators of how Dionysus was worshipped, showing the wild nature and passionate dancing customary to the cult. A main quality of Dionysiac worship was the idea of leaving the realm of the acceptable and acting in a manner antithetical to social norms and customs. This behavior explains why Dionysus was worshipped outside the city and mostly by women. In Greek society, women were subordinate to men, and thus when they left to worship Dionysus in this wild and unkempt manner, they showed a complete departure from social norms and an entrance into a different level of consciousness. The other images on this kylix also provide evidence about the worship and cult of Dionysus. The grapevines, satyrs, and thyrsus are all characteristics of the cult of Dionysus, providing symbols that can easily be associated with the cult. The grapevine is a symbol of Dionysus because he is the god of wine. The satyrs and the thyrsus also are symbols of the cult because they portray what and who were involved in worship. Additionally, on the second kylix, the Maenads are dancing around a statue of Dionysus. This practice was common in ancient Greece, and even though there was just a statue, the maenads believed that Dionysus inhabited it, and thus worshipped the statue as the god. This dance illustrates how Dionysiac worship took over one’s body and spirit. Although the third vessel does not have similar images to the first, it also is telling about the nature of Dionysus. The image of Dionysus and Heracles shows the dual nature of both deities. Both started out mortal and then were transformed into immortal gods. Thus, because Dionysus was both mortal and immortal, dead and alive, one can see his dual nature in this depiction. Also interesting about the depiction of these two characters is the connection to the wild natures of both. Dionysus in his very nature is untamed, and so is his worship. Heracles, with his brute strength is wild in a different kind of way, as his strength is too much for a normal human being. He is a hero that accomplishes tasks, but only can do so with his unkempt strength, also performing these tasks outside the city and away from social norms. On the inside of this third vessel, the clusters of grapes and the people at a symposium connect everything back to Dionysus and his worship through wine. Through drinking, dancing, and the total release of structure, we learn that Dionysiac worship is something on a different level of consciousness than normal worship, and the way people connected to this god was through a form of madness, induced by wine and sustained by spirit.</chars>
