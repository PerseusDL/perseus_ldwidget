        <chars xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2008/content#">This artwork portrayed on drinking cups uses symbolic representations to show the untamed and unstructured nature of Dionysiac worship. On the first kylix, there are depictions of dancing maenads, or female followers of Dionysus. These maenads are wonderful indicators of how Dionysus was worshipped, showing the wild nature and passionate dancing customary to the cult. A main quality of Dionysiac worship was the idea of leaving the realm of the acceptable and acting in a manner antithetical to social norms and customs. This behavior explains why Dionysus was worshipped outside the city and mostly by women. In Greek society, women were subordinate to men, and thus when they left to worship Dionysus in this wild and unkempt manner, they showed a complete departure from social norms and an entrance into a different level of consciousness. The other images on this kylix also provide evidence about the worship and cult of Dionysus. The grapevines, satyrs, and thyrsus are all characteristics of the cult of Dionysus, providing symbols that can easily be associated with the cult. The grapevine is a symbol of Dionysus because he is the god of wine. The satyrs and the thyrsus also are symbols of the cult because they portray what and who were involved in worship. Additionally, on the second kylix, the Maenads are dancing around a statue of Dionysus. This practice was common in ancient Greece, and even though there was just a statue, the maenads believed that Dionysus inhabited it, and thus worshipped the statue as the god. This dance illustrates how Dionysiac worship took over oneâ€™s body and spirit. Although the third vessel does not have similar images to the first, it also is telling about the nature of Dionysus. The image of Dionysus and Heracles shows the dual nature of both deities. Both started out mortal and then were transformed into immortal gods. Thus, because Dionysus was both mortal and immortal, dead and alive, one can see his dual nature in this depiction. Also interesting about the depiction of these two characters is the connection to the wild natures of both. Dionysus in his very nature is untamed, and so is his worship. Heracles, with his brute strength is wild in a different kind of way, as his strength is too much for a normal human being. He is a hero that accomplishes tasks, but only can do so with his unkempt strength, also performing these tasks outside the city and away from social norms. On the inside of this third vessel, the clusters of grapes and the people at a symposium connect everything back to Dionysus and his worship through wine. Through drinking, dancing, and the total release of structure, we learn that Dionysiac worship is something on a different level of consciousness than normal worship, and the way people connected to this god was through a form of madness, induced by wine and sustained by spirit.</chars>
